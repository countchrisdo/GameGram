Shh don't look

-On step 8

5 commits in, a couple of those were github markdown issues
Working on finishing User Authentication, i'm making new
No hurdles, just gotta work on it more and see what happens

As a User I would like to: Look for a video game to upload my screen shots too,easily browse between games pages, add a game if it doesn't exist yet, catagorise that game by genre to make it easy to find by other users, upload an image from my computer and have it hosted on the site, view the images on the page.

I need to add an update and delete feature as apart of CRUD which I will once I add images to the specific games and allow for captions. 

My biggest blocker is using this new middleware with no experience. I've been going through the docs, and it's a huge help. I actually feel like I'm learning a skill, like doing my own research on a middleware I wans't specifically instructed on. I feel like I understand routing way more, but it's also a stress because I feel confused at points. The docs are specified for people who are more used to this stuff
